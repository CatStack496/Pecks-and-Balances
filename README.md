# Pecks-and-Balances
This game was made as a submission for a game design competition about something we would like to bring awareness to.
The topic we chose was climate change.

This game is planned and meant to be a game akin to Sort the Court, but you recieve prompts over fax machine and you can see the effects of the prompts from the window of the throne room.
